Land Surface Temperature (LST) can be defined as the
temperature felt when the land surface is touched with the
hands or it is the skin temperature of the ground.

Before the invention of Earth Observation Satellites (EOS), it
was hard to estimate the LST of an area. Generally, it was
calculated for a particular set of sample points and interpolated
into isotherms to generalize the point data into area data. Now
with the advent of satellites and high resolution sensors it is
possible to estimate LST spatially. It can be calculated for a
region at a stretch with the use of thermal infrared bands
supplied by satellites. Landsat 8 comes with two different sets
of images from Operation Land Imager (OLI) sensor with nine
bands (band 1 to 9) and Thermal Infrared sensor (TIR) with
two bands (band 10 and 11).
